# HISTORY DEVELOPMENT
Since the beginnings of autonomous vehicles during the 1920s to the 1940s autonomous 
vehicles have rapidly improved throughout the years. The first thoughts of this advancement 
started with radio controlled cars and the first prototypes were created during the mid - 
twentieth century that were operated by electronic devices embedded in roadways. Now we are 
able to see many different companies such as Tesla and Ford starting to create even more 
advanced examples of autonomous vehicles, these are now able to understand the surroundings
they are placed in via using sophisticated sensors and cameras. Because of these swift 
advancements the market for autonomous vehicles has been growing in demand more recently 
and more and more investors, researchers and companies are looking into this field of 
autonomous vehicles.

# TYPES OF JOBS - Impact on Society
A Front-End Engineer in the automotive industry focuses on designing and developing the 
user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for automotive software applications, such as 
infotainment systems, navigation, and vehicle control interfaces. They work closely with 
designers, UX specialists, and back-end developers to create intuitive and visually 
appealing interfaces that enhance the driver and passenger experience.

# HOW DOES IT INFLUENCE INDUSTRIES AND TECHNOLOGY? - Impact on Society
Autonomous vehicles influences industries and technology by reducing demand of 
transportation, cyber security and potential for long runs. There are already a few of 
automatic vehicles such as Tesla and BMW that can functionally drive by itself only on 
highways and motorways, meaning that advance tech is limited. For transportation, truck 
drivers with potential of job loss and safety. These however is only the downsides of 
autonomous vehicles. The advantages of these vehicles can be safer when efficient, less 
traffic and greenhouse gas, fuel, and carbon dioxide which greatly reduces global warming. 
One of the high potential threats is cybersecurity. Itâ€™s because the autonomous vehicle run 
on technology, and can be hacked.
