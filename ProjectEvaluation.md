# Project Evaluation
## Evaluation of your INDIVIDUAL Final Test Case in relation to the Functional Criteria
The robot autonomously searches and sorts colored blocks while avoiding obstacles, utilizing its motors and sensors to carry 
out precise movements and object detection. The test situation employs a color sensor to detect red and yellow blocks, a 
gripper motor to pick up and drop blocks, and an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles. Movement is controlled using left and 
right motors, and predefined timing and speeds yield structured navigation.The EV3 robot moves forward, stops, senses blocks, 
picks up red or yellow blocks, drops them, and changes direction if there is a barrier. If there is a blockage within 20cm, 
the robot reverses and rotates prior to advancing.The test case demonstrates basic object recognition and sorting 
functionality via colour sensing and motor control. Error handling can be improvedâ€” addition of conditions for unrecognized 
color or irregular sensor input would render the program more robust. Furthermore, optimizing movement logic within obstacle 
avoidance (e.g., using alternate paths instead of a simple reversal and turn) would render the program more efficient in 
complex environments.

## Evaluation of your INDIVIDUAL Final Test Case in Relation to Non-Functional Criteria
The EV3 robot must be efficient, dependable, and easy to use in design to encourage seamless operation, responsiveness to 
various conditions, and ease of adaptability for future upgrades.
It uses modular functions for movement, object identification, and collision detection, enhancing maintainability and 
scalability. The robot processes sensor data in a pre-coded 20 cm range of obstacle detection, and moves with timed duration, 
enhancing performance and responsiveness.The robot perceives, responds, learns, and acts based on feedback from the 
environment. Its modularity enables efficient execution, giving organised operation while maintaining the code readable and 
readily modifiable. The program efficiently places emphasis on efficiency with modularisation, making it easy to debug and 
extend in the future. But modifications can make it stronger, for instance, by calibrating sensor thresholds to prevent 
potential false inputs or optimising motor speed changes for even smoother motor transitions. Besides,*usability would been 
enhanced by adding user-friendly logs or warnings for additional interaction and debugging.

## Evaluation of your GROUP'S Final Performance in Relation to the Identifying what needs to be done
The robot's performance relies on integrating multiple sensors to navigate and interact with objects successfully. Equipped 
with color and ultrasonic sensors, the robot sorts blocks and avoids obstacles and carries out given tasks with precision. The 
additional motor gives efficient manipulation of objects for successful completion of programmed movements.
The robot is equipped with an EV3 Colour Sensor to recognize red and yellow blocks and an Ultrasonic Sensor to recognize 
obstacles within 20 cm. It is equipped with two Large Motors for movement control and one other type of motor to operate the 
gripper to pick and release blocks. Program logic consists of structured steps: move forward, block colour sensing, pick and 
place blocks, and obstacle avoidance by reversing and turning.The robot proceeds to search for blocks, searches for colours 
using the colour sensor, and picks up objects with the gripper motor. Upon sensing an obstacle, it reverses and turns to avoid
bumping. The robot then goes to a particular place after picking up a block and drops the object, effectively performing its 
task in a sequence. The robot can effectively integrate the required sensors and motors, and the navigation and picking up of 
objects are effective. The color sensor successfully sorts blocks, and the ultrasonic sensor prevents collisions by 
triggering avoidance behaviors. The motor functions implement controlled movement and precise gripping behavior. However, 
improvements like improved turning logic for obstacle avoidance and an additional touch sensor for more accurate contact 
detection would take the system's performance to the next level.

## Evaluation of Project in Relation to Project Management
Effective project management ensures that the work is completed well, the use of resources is appropriately efficient, and the 
objectives are met within the set constraints. Organized planning, task allocation, and repeated problem-solving are key roles 
in maximizing the development for this robotics project. Integration of sensors, motors, and programming into one system 
requires proper coordination and fit. The project has a clear methodology, utilizing two sensors (colour and ultrasonic) for 
navigation and obstacle detection, and three motors for movement and object operation. Systematic implementation is maintained 
using program logic with ordered functions for movement, evasion from obstacles, and operation of blocks. Gradual improvements 
open up possibilities to improve turning logic, enhance object recognition, and optimize speed control for improving overall 
efficiency.The group carefully plans every phase of development, tasks are delegated to enable effective implementation and 
code is written that includes hardware aspects. Through the process of testing, the group identifies areas of improvement, 
makes iterative refinements in alignment with performance, and maximizes the robot's functions. Throughout the process, the 
group collaborates closely, debugs, and examines the effectiveness of every implementation.The project shows good project 
management procedures, with technical development weighing against strategic planning. The process is structured so that 
sensor and motor integration adheres to project objectives, and continuous testing optimizes performance. Even with success, 
further improvement in risk analysis, documentation, and time management could bring efficiency to facilitate smooth 
implementation in future developments.

## Evaluation of Project in Relation to Team Collaboration
Teamwork is what makes us efficient and sometimes challenging. Our group have been working in all areas and parts of the task 
and while someone does more of something and less of somethinge else, it can depends on the skills of coding, writing and 
explaining. One of us did most of the code due to him having more skills of coding compared to others while other friends do 
the pseudocode and flowcharts as well as helping others with the slides and project documentation. We were all contributing i 
all areas but the work was equal. We had a 2 people doing most of the slides while the other two did the code. If there is one 
thing we could improve on, maybe productivity. Our group in the beginning was distracted from something irrelevant and were 
slightly behind on doing the task, but we pulled ourself together and worked to the best of our ability. 

## Identification and Evaluation of Future Improvements to your Final Product
Streamlining the final product involves rewriting the code for greater efficiency, responsiveness, and performance as a whole.
Areas of improvement can be identified to optimize navigation, obstacle avoidance, and block management more effectively. 
Small adjustments in sensor inputs and movement mechanics can potentially make the robot more effective and efficient.The 
current code utilizes colour and ultrasonic sensor for sensing, large motors for movement, and a middle motor for handling 
objects. These components do work well, but there is room for improvement in the precision of turns, adaptive speed 
management, and sensor feedback loops to make movements and decisions more accurate. The addition of a touch sensor to 
confirm contact with objects and an improved obstacle avoidance mechanism would provide additional functionality.Future 
versions may enhance movement logic by having variable turnings and dynamic speed control through feedback from sensors. The 
obstacle detection mode could be enhanced to learn by direction or distance. A touch sensor for enhanced object manipulation 
could be included as a feature to enhance precision and reliability. While the current implementation is functional, 
optimizing sensor feedback and movement control would improve the performance. Tuning turn mechanisms, adaptive speed, and 
adding additional sensors could improve navigation smoothness and make object handling more predictable. These changes would 
allow the robot to operate with greater accuracy and efficiency in various environments.
